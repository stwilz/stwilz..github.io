        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I recently moved my personal website to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> 
which was super simple with the exception of one hiccup. I wanted to be able to
serve my website from a subfolder which requires a subtree, but personal github 
pages only allow your website to be served from the master branch.</p>
<p>After a little experimenting I found that I was able to convert my master branch 
to be a subtree which only contained the files I wanted to serve. Below is 
a step by step process that you can follow to do the same. And if you need an 
example project you can just <a href="https://github.com/stwilz/stwilz.github.io/">use my website</a>! :)</p>
<h2 id="how-to-turn-master-into-a-subtree">How to turn master into a subtree</h2>
<ol>
<li>Clone your repo
 I know, der, but whatever. You&#39;re obviously going to need to pull down your repo to get started.<pre><code>     git clone https://github.com/{repo}/{repo}.github.io.git
</code></pre></li>
<li>Create a develop branch
 Next, we are going to need a new branch to develop or code on. <pre><code>     git checkout -b develop
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Set develop to be your primary branch</p>
</li>
<li><p>Delete the repositories master branch
 Don&#39;t worry, we will make a new one. But for now the master branch must die.</p>
<pre><code>     git push origin --delete master
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Build out your production files
 You assumably have your own build process so run your requires metalsmith/gulp/grunt/webpack
 command and build your static files out to whatever directory you want to use.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Commit your production files to master as a subtree
 Now stage, commit and push your files. Below I use the <code>dist</code> directory so if you are not using
 that naming convention you will need to update the command accordingly.</p>
<pre><code> git stage -A
 git commit -m &quot;compiled files for release 1.0.0
 git subtree push --prefix dist origin master
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="that-s-it-">That&#39;s it!</h2>
<p>If you are seeing an error at first don&#39;t freak out. Github pages sometimes does take a little while
to update.</p>
