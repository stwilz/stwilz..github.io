<h2 id="what-">What?</h2>
<p>If you have a digital product, business or service that focuses on an end user, 
there&#39;s a good chance I&#39;m your guy. I have 12 years experience in designing 
and developing web platforms, App and digital services. Over those years I have 
taken numerous projects, both large and small, from concept to completion.</p>
<h2 id="why-">Why?</h2>
<p>I love to create and I&#39;m an incessant problem solver. I&#39;m extremely passionate about
developing products that are engaging for users and developing ways to quickly
iterate on a product to improve services and user experience.</p>
<h2 id="how-">How?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a deep respect for applying research and hypothesis to a solution. Whether it&#39;s
the user experience, design language or the application architecture I believe 
that all key decisions for a product need to be backed by evidence, tested and 
iterated on based on user feedback.</p>
