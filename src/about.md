# About
## What?
If you have a digital product, business or service that focuses on an end user, 
there's a good chance I'm your guy. I have 12 years experience in designing 
and developing web platforms, App and digital services. Over those years I have 
taken numerous projects, both large and small, from concept to completion.

## Why?
I love to create and I'm an incessant problem solver. I'm extremely passionate about
developing products that are engaging for users and developing ways to quickly
iterate on a product to improve services and user experience.

## How?
  > Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.

I have a deep respect for applying research and hypothesis to a solution. Whether it's
the user experience, design language or the application architecture I believe 
that all key decisions for a product need to be backed by evidence, tested and 
iterated on based on user feedback.
