                        <p>If you have a digital product, business or service that focuses on an end user, there's a good chance I'm your guy. I have 12 years experience in designing and developing web platforms, App and digital services. Over those years I have taken numerous projects, both large and small, from concept to completion.</p>

                        <h2>Why</h2>
                        <p>I love to create and I'm an incessant problem solver. I'm extremely passionate about developing products that are engaging for users and developing ways to quickly iterate on a product to improve services and user experience.</p>

                        <h2>How</h2>
                        <p>I have a deep respect for applying research and hypothesis to a solution. Whether it's the user experience, design language or the application architecture I believe that all key decisions for a product need to be backed by evidence, tested and iterated on based on user feedback.</p>
